Winfingerprint 0.1.0 03/12/2001 
Initial release of winfingerprint with integrated GUI! This 
version is basically winfingerprint 2.29 with an MFC GUI.
winfingerprint 2.29 is a commandline application and is now
available as winfingerprintclassic in CVS.

Successful merger of winfingerprintclassic 2.29 command line version of winfingerprint and wfple 0.1.0. winfingerprintclassic was very stable although it was commandline. wfple was a short lived, limited edition as I migrated to the MFC GUI version.
